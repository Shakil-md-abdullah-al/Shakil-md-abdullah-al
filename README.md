## Who am I ?
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am MD. Abdullah Al Shakil. I am an intern at BASIS - BITM under the PHP with Laravel program. Through this program, I have very good knowledge of front-end development with the Bootstrap framework and back-end development with raw PHP along with the Laravel framework. Also, I have completed short training at WSDA - Workplace Skill Development Academy (New Zealand). Again, I am going with my two theses at this time on medical imaging. The first one is on medical imaging, and it is almost done. The second one is the Anti-Money Laundering System using machine learning and deep learning.

I am continuing with my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Bangladesh University of Business and Technology. I have completed my diploma in Web Design and Development from LEDP (Learning and Earning Development Project).

I am a good problem solver and I solve problems on a regular basis and commit them on Github. Also, I have leadership qualities. During my thesis paper completions, I lead my team and properly manage and instruct my team along with my university projects. Again, I can easily adapt to new things and take a very short time to learn new things.

I think I can do something special for my team and organization. I am an open-source Contributor and a web development addict.
